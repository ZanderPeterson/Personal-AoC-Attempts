This is my attempt for the 2nd AoC Challenge in the 
2024 Advent of Code.

## After Challenge Thoughts:
Well the first part, similar to the previous day, was drastically
more difficult than the second part. However, I learned some things
that will better my coding moving forward. Small mistakes were
made, but now I won't (hopefully) make the same mistakes again.

For the second part I probably could've done things more efficiently,
but the way I did it still worked. Sometimes I might revisit this
one, and have a proper think about efficient solutions.
