## After Challenge Thoughts:
Well, that one took a lot longer than the other ones.
Turned out I made an off-by-one error, which caused me significant
delay. The second one also had an unexpected issue, it was as if
if statements didn't work anymore. After some thinking... well,
I shouldn't be shocked that "A" != "a".

But, these kind of mistakes lead to learning. Speaking of mistakes,
I was reading through the Advent of Code website and discovered
I am not supposed to show my inputs for copyright reasons, see: <br>
https://adventofcode.com/2024/about <br>
While I will not retroactively get rid of my 2024 Day 01, 02, 03
& 04 inputs, I will ensure I don't publish my inputs henceforth.
If I need to remove the inputs for the last 4 days I can, but they
are unfortunately all ready out there. Sorry!
