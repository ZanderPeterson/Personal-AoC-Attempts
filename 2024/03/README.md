## After Challenge Thoughts:
The first stage was difficult, which is fairly typical. However,
the second stage was also rather difficult. This is in part due
to the way I solved the first stage not applying well to the
second, and partly because of some small errors I made which
caused a lot of pain. However, as usual, I have learned from
this experience and should do better in subsequent challenges.
Afterall, this is supposed to be a learning experience.
