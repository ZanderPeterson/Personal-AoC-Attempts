## After Challenge Thoughts:
This challenge was my first AoC Challenge, done 11 days 
after its initial posting. It took me around an hour, with 
the first part taking significantly longer than the second. 
This is because I encountered a number of challenges I didn't
expect, and small mistakes I had made throughout the code. 
What I learned from the second part also helped me tidy up the
first part because the way I initially dealt with the dataset
wasn't very intelligent.

Nevertheless, they were a fun challenge and I learned new
things, so that is a complete win.

I don't think I'll come up with alternative solutions, at
least not yet. I may revisit this in the future.
