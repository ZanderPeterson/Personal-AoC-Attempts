This is my attempt for the 5th AoC Challenge in the 
2024 Advent of Code.

## After Challenge Thoughts:
The first step went well. After some thought, I implemented a 
solution that managed to work first try, which I was
proud of. For the second step I was just going to
brute force an answer because I was struggling to muster
a proper solution, but realised I was in 
NASA-Computer-Running-Operation-Since-The-Big-Bang levels
of inefficient. After a while I can up with a proper solution
that executed in less than a second (I didn't measure
the actual time - it wasn't much.)

Although I didn't make small mistakes in implementation - 
once I figured out a solution I could just do it - this was
still an interesting challenge to try to complete.

Additionally, I learned how to use a .gitignore file, so now
I can hide my inputs to align with the Advent of Code About
Page.
