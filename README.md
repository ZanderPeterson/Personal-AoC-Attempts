# Personal-AoC-Attempts
Personal-AoC-Attempts is a repository where I post the solutions, or at least my attempts, to Advent of Code (AoC) problems.
This repository was started on the 12th of December, 2024, which is when I did my first ever Advent of Code (and, when I found
out about Advent of Code, for that matter).

Since it appears I can complete previous challenges, I intend on doing all the challenges I missed from 2015 to 2023, and
also complete the challenges from the 1st of December, 2024, to the 11th of December, 2024.

I may not be able to complete every challenge for every day, but I intend to try.
